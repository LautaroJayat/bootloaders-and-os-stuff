# ðŸ§¨ 01 - Minimal Boot Sector (16-bit Assembly)

This is the absolute minimal valid x86 bootloader, written in NASM.

It doesnâ€™t print anything. It doesnâ€™t do anything.  
**But it boots.** And thatâ€™s the whole point.

## ðŸ§  What It Does

This boot sector:

- Tells the BIOS "I am a bootable disk"
- Loads to memory address `0x7C00`
- Jumps to an infinite loop
- Nothing else

Itâ€™s the literal starting point of an OS â€” just enough to **not crash the computer**.
