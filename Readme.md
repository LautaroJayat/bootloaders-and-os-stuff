# :alien: Bootloaders and OS Stuff

This repository contains a collection of experiments related to bootloaders and operating systems, written in assembly, C, and who knows what else. Each folder has a minimal working example designed to test or demonstrate a specific idea in early-stage system programming.

---

## ðŸ›  Requirements

To build and run the experiments, youâ€™ll need:

- [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) â€“ Netwide Assembler
- [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) â€“ Emulator for testing bootable binaries
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) â€“ Build automation tool (or compatible)

Each experiment has its own `Makefile` to assemble and launch in QEMU.

| [`01_hello_boot/`](https://github.com/LautaroJayat/bootloaders-and-os-stuff/tree/main/01_hello_boot)                           | A minimal 512-byte boot sector that simply halts the CPU.                                                                                                                    |
| [`02_hello_world/`](https://github.com/LautaroJayat/bootloaders-and-os-stuff/tree/main/02_hello_world)                         | A boot sector that prints a message via BIOS interrupts, waits for three keypresses, then halts.                                                                             |
| [`03_two_stage_fat12_floppy/`](https://github.com/LautaroJayat/bootloaders-and-os-stuff/tree/main/03_two_stage_fat12_floppy)   | A two-stage FAT12 loader: Stage 1 reads the FAT12 BPB, converts LBA to CHS, and loads sector 1; Stage 2 is linked at 0x7E00, prints a message, then halts.                   |
| [`04_kernel_search_n_load/`](https://github.com/LautaroJayat/bootloaders-and-os-stuff/tree/main/04_kernel_search_n_load)       | A two-stage FAT12 loader: Stage 1 reads the FAT12 BPB, converts LBA to CHS, then finds the kernel in the disk image; Stage 2 is then executed, prints a message, then halts. |
| [`05_simplest_grub/`](https://github.com/LautaroJayat/bootloaders-and-os-stuff/tree/main/05_simplest_grub)                     | The simplest way to make your kernel boot using grub. Here we offload all the setup for protected mode and load directly into grub :)                                        |
| [`06_writing_to_video_memory/`](https://github.com/LautaroJayat/bootloaders-and-os-stuff/tree/main/06_writing_to_video_memory) | Creating a simple routine to print some messages by writing directly to video memory                                                                                         |

## ðŸ“Ž Purpose

Iâ€™m exploring how machines boot from raw binary instructions. This project is my personal deep dive into low-level systems: starting from the tiniest 512-byte boot stub, moving on to two-stage loaders, and eventually building a toy OS from scratch.
