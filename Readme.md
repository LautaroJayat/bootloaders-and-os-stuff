# ðŸ§µ Bootloaders and OS Stuff

This repository contains a collection of experiments related to bootloaders and operating systems, written in assembly, C, and who knows what else. Each folder has a minimal working example designed to test or demonstrate a specific idea in early-stage system programming.

---

## ðŸ›  Requirements

To build and run the experiments, youâ€™ll need:

- [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) â€“ Netwide Assembler
- [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) â€“ Emulator for testing bootable binaries
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) â€“ Build automation tool (or compatible)

Each experiment has its own `Makefile` to assemble and launch in QEMU.

## ðŸ“‚ Experiments

| Experiment | Description | README |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| `01_hello_boot/` | Minimal bootable program that halts the CPU. | [View README](https://github.com/LautaroJayat/bootloaders-and-os-stuff/tree/main/01_hello_boot) |
| `02_hello_world/` | Prints a message using BIOS interrupts, waits for keypresses, and repeats 3 times. | [View README](https://github.com/LautaroJayat/bootloaders-and-os-stuff/tree/main/02_hello_world) |

## ðŸ“Ž Purpose

I'm just exploring how machines boot from raw binary instructions.  
This project is part of my personal deep dive into low-level systems â€” starting from scratch with assembly and gradually moving toward a toy OS.
