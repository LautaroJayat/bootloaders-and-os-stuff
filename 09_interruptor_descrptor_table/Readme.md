# :alien: Super Kernel â€” Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)

Welcome to the interrupt handling phase of our kernel! This chapter focuses on implementing the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) and setting up our first interrupt handlers. Let's explore how interrupts work and why they're crucial for our operating system.

## IDT: The Gateway to Interrupt Handling

The IDT is a fundamental structure that maps interrupt vectors to their corresponding handlers. It allows our kernel to:
- Handle hardware interrupts (keyboard, timer, etc.)
- Manage software interrupts (system calls)
- Process CPU exceptions (divide by zero, page faults)

Our IDT implementation includes:
- 256 interrupt gate entries
- Custom interrupt handlers
- Exception handling support
- A robust error reporting system

## Exception Handling: Keeping Things Under Control

We've implemented handlers for critical CPU exceptions:
- Division by zero (#DE)
- General Protection Fault (#GP)
- Page Fault (#PF)
- Double Fault (#DF)

Each handler provides detailed error information, helping us diagnose and debug kernel issues more effectively.

## The Bigger Picture

Adding interrupt support isn't just about handling errors. It's about:
- Creating a robust error handling system
- Preparing for hardware device drivers
- Enabling future system call implementation
- Building a foundation for multitasking

This marks a significant step toward a fully functional operating system capable of responding to both hardware and software events.
