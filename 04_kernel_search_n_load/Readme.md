# FAT12 Two-Stage Bootloader (Reading from disk edition)

**Time to get your hands dirty!!** 🚀  
This project is an experiment for building a true two-stage x86 real-mode bootloader that lives on a FAT12 floppy and a small “kernel” that gets read and loaded from disk.
In this example we use the fat headers to search for the files and load them into memory.
No OS, no cheats—just raw NASM, BIOS interrupts, and a healthy dose of disk geometry math.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Stage 1 Bootloader**  
   - Lives at sector 0 (LBA 0 → 0×0000:0×7C00)  
   - Contains a FAT12 BIOS Parameter Block (BPB)  
   - Implements `lba_to_chs` + `disk_read` via `INT 13h` with retries & error handling 
   - Implements little math to locate files in the FAT12 file system
   - Locates the kernel and jups to its first instruction  

2. **Stage 2 Kernel**  
   - Assembled with `ORG 0x0`, no magic offsets needed  
   - Simple `print` routine via `INT 10h` teletype to show  
     ```
     Hi, I’m printing from the kernel!
     ```  
   - Executes `hlt` in an infinite loop  

3. **Makefile Magic**  
   - `make bootloader` → NASM → `build/boot.bin`  
   - `make kernel`     → NASM → `build/kernel.bin`  
   - `make floppy_img` → `dd` zeros + `boot.bin` @ sector 0  and then mcopy `kernel.bin` to kernel.bin inside the image  
   - `make boot`       → QEMU spins up the floppy and boots
