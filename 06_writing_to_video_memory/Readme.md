# ðŸŽ¥ Writing to Video Memory! (Super Kernel)

After successfully booting our bare-metal kernel using GRUB in 32-bit protected mode, we're now taking the next big stepâ€”**directly writing to video memory** to display text on the screen. This is an exciting moment because we are no longer relying on BIOS interrupts (which aren't available in protected mode)â€”we're now talking to the hardware ourselves! ðŸ’ª

This feature gives us basic output capability, enabling us to build more complex debugging and system messaging functions from here on.

## ðŸ§  How It Works (Updated)

### 1. **Multiboot Bootloader (`boot.asm`)**
- This assembly file defines a Multiboot header, allowing GRUB to load our kernel.
- It sets up a basic stack and then jumps to our C `kmain()` function.
- No BIOS callsâ€”GRUB puts us directly into 32-bit **protected mode**.

### 2. **Kernel (`kernel.c`)**
- Starts by calling `Reset()` to clear the screen.
- Uses `print()` to display a message directly to video memory.
- We'll keep enhancing this with custom printing, colors, scrolling, and formatting.

### 3. **Video Output (`vga.c` + `vga.h`)**
- Implements basic `print()` logic by writing characters to memory address `0xB8000`.
- Includes support for new lines (`\n`), carriage returns (`\r`), and tabs (`\t`).
- Manages screen scrolling and cursor position.

### 4. **Linker Script (`linker.ld`)**
- Places the kernel at memory address `0x100000` (1MB).
- Organizes `.text`, `.data`, and `.bss` sections correctly for GRUB and the CPU.

### 5. **GRUB + ISO Image**
- We use `grub.cfg` to load the kernel with the `multiboot` directive.
- An ISO is generated using `grub-mkrescue` for booting in QEMU.
