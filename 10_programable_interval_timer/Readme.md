# :stopwatch: Super Kernel â€” Programmable Interval Timer (PIT)

Welcome to the timing chapter of our kernel! Here we implement the Programmable Interval Timer (PIT), our first hardware interrupt handler. This component is crucial for managing time-based operations in our operating system.

## The PIT: Heart of the System

The 8253/8254 Programmable Interval Timer serves as the system's primary timing device. Our implementation:
- Configures the PIT to generate interrupts at a precise frequency (1000Hz)
- Sets up IRQ0 to handle timer interrupts
- Maintains a system tick counter
- Enables precise timing and scheduling capabilities

Key features include:
- Configurable frequency settings
- Interrupt-driven timer events
- System uptime tracking
- Foundation for task scheduling

## Implementation Details

Our timer system consists of several key components:
- PIT initialization and configuration
- IRQ0 handler setup
- Timer callback registration
- Tick counting mechanism

Configuration values:
```c
const uint32_t freq = 1000;          // 1000Hz = 1ms per tick
uint32_t divisor = 1193180 / freq;   // PIT input frequency / desired frequency
```

## The Bigger Picture

The PIT implementation is essential for:
- Task scheduling and preemption
- Time-based operations and delays
- System uptime tracking
- Power management features

This marks our first step into hardware interrupt handling and real-time system management.
